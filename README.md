# Data Engineering Project
This is a data engineering project that involves collecting weather data from weatherapi.com, setting up a data pipeline using Kafka, performing data transformations, storing the data in PostgreSQL, generating visualizations, and establishing automation.

# Project Components
Data Collection: Collect weather data from the Weather API provided by weatherapi.com.

Data Pipeline: Set up a data pipeline using Kafka to collect weather data for a specific date range.

Data Transformations: Perform necessary transformations on the collected weather data.

Data Storage: Store the transformed weather data in PostgreSQL.

Data Visualization: Generate visualizations based on the stored weather data.

Automation: Schedule the data pipeline to run periodically and automate the entire process.

# Step-by-Step Guide
## 1. Data Collection
Use the Weather API provided by weatherapi.com to collect weather data.
Retrieve an API key from weatherapi.com.
Determine the location for which you want to collect weather data.
Make requests to the Weather API endpoint with the appropriate parameters (API key, location, start date, end date).
Parse the JSON response and extract the relevant weather data.
## 2. Data Pipeline
Set up Kafka on local machine.
Install the kafka-python library to interact with Kafka.
Define the Kafka bootstrap servers configuration, which specifies the address and port of the Kafka broker(s).
Create a Kafka topic to store the weather data.
Implement a Kafka producer that sends the collected weather data to the Kafka topic.
## 3. Data Transformations
Analyze the collected weather data and identify the required transformations.
## 4. Data Storage
Install PostgreSQL on local machine.
Install the psycopg2 library to interact with PostgreSQL from Python.
Set up a PostgreSQL database to store the weather data.
Define the necessary database connection details (host, database name, username, password).
Create a table in the database to hold the weather data based on the desired schema.
Implement the PostgreSQL connection to store the transformed weather data in the database.
## 5. Data Visualization
Install the matplotlib library to create visualizations.
Define the specific visualizations you want to generate from the weather data (e.g., time series plot, bar chart, etc.).
Retrieve the required data from the PostgreSQL database using SQL queries.
Utilize the matplotlib library to create visualizations based on the retrieved data.
Customize the visualizations by adding labels, titles, legends, etc.
Display the visualizations using the appropriate matplotlib functions.
## 6. Automation
Install the schedule library to schedule the data pipeline.
Define the desired schedule for running the data pipeline (e.g., daily, hourly, etc.).
Implement a function that encapsulates the entire data engineering process, from data collection to visualization generation.
Use the schedule library to schedule the execution of the function based on the defined schedule.
Run the scheduled tasks indefinitely to automate the data engineering project.
